generation model will be very similar to the sentiment models you've built previously. The only real change necessary is to make sure to use Categorical instead of Binary Cross Entropy as the loss function - we could use Binary before since the sentiment was only 0 or 1, but now there are hundreds of categories.\n","\n","From there, we should also consider using *more* epochs than before, as text generation can take a little longer to converge than sentiment analysis, *and* we aren't working with all that much data yet.
